# RAG and AI Agent for Healthcare

## Project Overview
The **RAG and AI Agent for Healthcare** project leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and advanced AI capabilities to provide accurate and context-aware answers to healthcare-related queries. This system is designed to assist users in extracting relevant information from healthcare documents, enabling efficient and intelligent data retrieval.

## Key Features
1. **PDF Document Support**: Upload healthcare-related PDFs are processed and stored in a vector database for efficient retrieval.
2. **Vector Database Integration**: The embedded content from PDFs is stored in a vector database, allowing quick and precise access to relevant information.
3. **Query Handling with LLM**: User queries are embedded and stored in the vector database, enabling semantic search to match user prompts with relevant content.
4. **RAG Framework**: Combines retrieval and generative capabilities to provide detailed and contextually accurate answers based on the uploaded documents.

## Workflow
1. **Document Upload**: The Uploaded PDF containing healthcare-related information.
2. **Data Embedding**: The content of the PDF is processed, embedded, and stored in a vector database.
3. **User Query Input**: Users submit their queries through the interface.
4. **Query Matching**: The system searches the vector database to find the most relevant content based on the query.

## Use Cases
- Healthcare professionals can retrieve guidelines, protocols, or research data quickly.
- Patients can access information about symptoms, treatments, or medications.
- Researchers can analyze and extract insights from large medical documents.

## Technologies Used
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: For natural language processing and generation.
- **Vector Databases**: For embedding storage and semantic search.
- **Python Libraries**: For data processing and integration.

## Conclusion
The **RAG and AI Agent for Healthcare** project demonstrates the power of AI in transforming healthcare data retrieval and processing. By combining RAG techniques with vector databases, 
this system provides accurate, fast, and context-aware responses, making it a valuable tool for healthcare professionals, researchers, and patients alike.
